    <h2> Inspect composer. </h2>
    <p>My name is Pixel (<a href="https://en.pronouns.page/he&they">he/they</a>). I am a rising junior at <a
        href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a> studying <a
        href="https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=7&poid=262">engineering</a>
      and <a
        href="https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=7&poid=264">environmental
        studies</a>. I am based in North Jersey a.k.a. the Fake New York City
      area. I am a member of the Chinese, Yi, and Burmese diaspora.
    <p> I have little to no business trying to spend time coding a website as
      frontend development is just one tool in my <a
        href=toolbox.html>Toolbox</a>, like how I have also picked up graphic
      design, SEO, and managing spreadsheets.
    <p> I've always enjoyed organizing things. Maybe too much. My nickname in
      high school was Mr. Resource Man because I have a knack to make the
      connections that people ask you for. My friends like to utilize this skill
      to get me to find songs for them from TikTok. I also tend to reminisce on
      2000's aesthetics: though I wouldn't call it <a href="https://transreads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-17_5c8e0a3735bb0_eli-clare-exile-and-pride-disability-queerness-and-liberation1.pdf">nostalgia</a>.
    <p>I seek to nurture communities and understand how people are impacted by
      their natural and built environments in cities. This tends to include
      issues of building infrastructure, renewable energy systems, housing, transportation, and education.
      I fancy exploring the field of digital humanities and thinking about how
      we can reimagine the documentation of storytelling experiences. I dream
      about what the world would look like after societal collapse and how we
      could practice picking up the pieces. Or placing <a href="https://bots-as-digital-infrapunctures.dataschool.nl/category/track-1-digital-infrapunctures.html">punctures</a> to create points of release and relief in the system. <a href="http://www.boggscenter.org/html/fi-12-03-05_another_world.html">I believe that another world is
      possible â€” another world is already here.</a></p> Feel free to shoot me an

    <h2> Inspect site. </h2>
    <p> This website was made in HTML with CSS styling built in rather than on a
      separate CSS file. If you press [F12] you can see exactly how I made this
      site page by page. My first time learning how to code in HTML was when I
      was in the sixth grade. I generally take notes in Obsidian.md using GitHub
      Flavored Markdown and LaTeX and only use HTML when it is relevant for
      editing on WordPress, Tumblr, and Pokemon forums. I don't know everything,
      I only know what I know, and I try to get decent at it.
    <p> I take inspiration from the work of Olia Lianlina and Dragan
      Espenschied's archive of <a
        href="https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/">GeoCities</a> as
      well as Kyle Drake's revival of the framework on <a
        href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a>. <a rel="me"
