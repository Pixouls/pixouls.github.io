    <h2> Inspect composer. </h2>
    <p>My name is Pixel. I am a sophomore at <a
        href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a> studying <a
        href="https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=7&poid=262">engineering</a>
      and <a
        href="https://catalog.swarthmore.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=7&poid=264">environmental
        studies</a>. I am based in North Jersey a.k.a. the Fake New York City
      area.
    <p> I have little to no business trying to spend time coding a website as
      frontend development is just one tool in my <a
        href=toolbox.html>TOOLBOX</a>, like how I have also picked up graphic
      design, marketing, and managing spreadsheets because I could.
    <p> I've always enjoyed organizing things. Maybe too much. My nickname in
      high school was Mr. Resource Man because I have a knack to make the
      connections that people ask you for. My friends like to utilize this skill
      to get me to find songs for them from TikTok. I also tend to reminisce on
      2000's aesthetics: though I wouldn't call it nostalgia.
    <p>I seek to nurture communities and understand how people are impacted by
      their natural and built environments in cities. This tends to include
      issues of building infrastrucutre, housing, transportation, and education.
      I fancy exploring the field of digital humanities and thinking about how
      we can reimagine the documentation of storytelling experiences. I dream
      about what the world would look like after societal collapse and how we
      could practice picking up the pieces. I believe that another world is
      possible â€” another world is already here.</p> Feel free to shoot me an

    <h2> Inspect site. </h2>
    <p> This website was made in HTML with CSS styling built in rather than on a
      separate CSS file. If you press [F12] you can see exactly how I made this
      site page by page. My first time learning how to code in HTML was when I
      was in the sixth grade. I generally take notes in Obsidian.md using GitHub
      Flavored Markdown and LaTeX and only use HTML when it is relevant for
      editing on WordPress, Tumblr, and Pokemon forums. I don't know everything,
      I only know what I know, and I try to get decent at it.
    <p> I take inspiration from the work of Olia Lianlina and Dragan
      Espenschied's archive of <a
        href="https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/">GeoCities</a> as
      well as Kyle Drake's revival of the framework on <a
        href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a>.
