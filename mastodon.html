    <h2> Mastodon </h2>
    <h3> What is Mastodon? </h3> Mastodon is a software for hosting social media
    network instances. You can learn about how it works on the <a
      href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Join Mastodon website</a>. It is
    <b>decentralized</b> meaning no one owns the entire social media platform,
    instead people can host <b>instances</b> and then choose to connect to each
    other through <b>federation</b>. This means no ads, no algos, better
    moderation, and more genuine interactions. <h3> How can I follow you?</h3>
    The Mastodon instance my account lives on, <a
      href="https://post.lurk.org/about/more">post.lurk.org</a> is run by <a
      href="https://lurk.org/">Lurk_</a>. By joining them through <a rel="me"
      href="https://post.lurk.org/@pixouls">my account</a>, I am able to connect
    to others who share my interests on their instance, as well as those that
    they are federated with on other instances. <p>Everything stays saved on
      their server, so I know where my information is being kept. To follow me,
      you can find an instance on Mastodon that shares your interests and values
      and then connect to me from there.
    <h3> What's it like there? </h3> The communites I interact with on Mastodon
    are mainly focused on F(L)OSS (Free, Liberated, Open-Source Software),
    accessibility design, and computational culture. Some of those communities
    include: <ul>
      <li><a href="https://2600.hackers.town/">Hackers.town</a>
      <li>#CircusInPlace, led by <a href="https://circusfreaks.org/">Circus
          Freaks</a>
      <li><a href="https://humanetech.community/">Humane Tech</a>
    </ul> I can also be found on the <a href="">Described Media</a> community
    list as I make regular efforts to produce media (images, videos, etc.) that
    is described, particularly through the usage of alt text.
