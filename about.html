    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> <img src="files\icon.jpg"
        alt="a dithered image of me surrounded by flowers" style="width:40%">
    </p>
    <p>I am currently superimposed between Philadelphia and New York City. You
      may know me by a variety of names but I have no preference, as long as I
      know it's me. I am a member of the Chinese, Yi, and Burmese Diaspora who
      grew up in North Jersey.
    <p>I was born on Lunar New Year, the tail end of the year of the dragon. My
      family likes to refer to me as the smallest dragon because of this. I'm
      also the youngest of my siblings. I think <a
        href="https://coleo_kin.itch.io/why-small">small is good</a>.
    <p> Due to my visual/audtiory processing, you will often find me wearing
      earplugs and with captions on. I am a big advocate for <a
        href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">#a11y</a>. I listen to <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/user/bu7fiz20cy84p7kobe1qiifo1?si=c3cfae3f3a91485f">a
        variety of music</a> from funk to punk caberet math rock to progressive
      post-hardcore to city pop. I consider music to be a very important part of
      my life and would be happy to make you a playlist if you'd like. </p>
