    <h2> TOOLBOX </h2>
    <p> This is my toolbox. It's a raw collection of my favorite tools. I love
      to collect tools to find new ways to organize, share, and learn
      information in ways that are unconventional, more accessible, and
      especially: paperless. Most of these platforms are free or free with .edu
      email. I'm a broke college kid afterall.
    <p>Also, here are some lists from the <a

      popular for making "pretty" newsletters for free, MailChimp is actually a
      general marketing tool that can plan out more than just newsletters. Don't
      get easily swayed to thinking that the paid version is a must have, there

    <a href="https://www.sumopaint.com/">SumoPaint</a>
    <blockquote>SumoPaint was one of the first free drawing programs I ever used
      because their program is optimized to be used on your browser. While I
      wouldn't consider it among the best of its kind, it's definitely a solid
      contender for learning how to get used to digital illustration tools if
      you're a beginner.</blockquote>

      by setting certain access hours or a total amount. Great for getting
      yourself to build up habits to become less dependent on social media
      sites. While the extension now seems to be developed out under <a
        href="https://freedom.to">Freedom</a> which offers a broader variety of

    <blockquote>Collaborative coding without all the fluff. Quickly get a link

      teams. </blockquote>
    <a href="https://mweb.im/">MWeb</a>
    <blockquote>An easy, no nonsense, and free-to-use markdown editor that
      supports cloud storage. I use this when I need to edit files from my
      Obsidian on the go. It obviously won't support backlinks, since everything
      is written in markdown, nothing will be lost no matter what platform the

      running live polls, quizzes, word clouds, Q&As — all on just ONE
      presentation platform. Also has a number of integration support for other
      presentation platforms such as Miro and Brella. Mentimeter is an

      game-changer. </blockquote>

      My definite go-to for creating creative and interactive experiences.

    <a href="https://monday.com/">Monday</a>
    <blockquote>Not your average project management spreadsheet. Build up your

      Monday seeing what everyone is up to while knowing exactly what YOU need

    <blockquote>The platform that made kanban view mainstream. Great for teams
      or personal use, Trello makes the most of the kanban experience by making
      each card so much more than just a card. Trello was personally especially
      useful for me as a web developer to recieve tickets for bugs and
      improvements from my client easily. Trello was recently acquired by <a
        href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> which also develops
      another well known software development tool for agile teams known as <a

    <blockquote>Faster, more secure, and lighter than Chrome — but still built

      rewards system for content creators, though it requires you to create an
      <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a> account which asks for your
      financial info. </blockquote>
    <a href="https://darksky.net/">Dark Sky</a></br>
    <blockquote>The Dark Sky Company originally launched the web version of
      their services on <a href="forecast.io">Forecast.io</a> until they decided
      to push DarkSky.net to be better optimzed with the features they'd built
      for the mobile application. Apple recently acquired Dark Sky which meant
      in a few years restrictions for the API would be rolled out. Personally, I
      can't imagine using any other weather app, with a clean UI that allows you
      to see weather patterns over time and see accurate precitipation
      predictions unlike what I've seen anywhere else, I hope some version of
      Dark Sky is preserved for the whole internet without a paywall.

    <blockquote>It's hard to tell if blue light glasses, you know... work. So
      instead of making that investment, tune it down from your screen itself.
      Flux adjusts the tint of your screen based on the time of day. Just
      remember to turn it off if you're doing color sensitive work into the
      evening hours — I say as an illustrator who realizes too late that I'm
      working on the wrong palette. </blockquote>

      to be my favorite Chinese-English dictionary. However, around 2014, it was
      shut down and set to redirect to Line Dictionary. Many of the features had
      to be rebuilt from the wealth that once was the original platform, the UX
      is still among my favorite for Chinese-English dictionaries on desktop.
    </blockquote>
    <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a>
    <blockquote>Loom lets you quickly sharescreen recordings either utilizng a
      desktop or chrome extension. If you're familar with <a
        href="Gayzo.com">Gyazo</a>, I'd say Loom is somewhat like that in its
      quick url generating capabilites for your screenshots, but even better
      optimized for screen recordings, making it especially useful for working
      with clients by sending screenrecordings with voice-overs when reporting
      bugs and feature updates with a few clicks of a button and giving them an
      easy link to access the clip from. It supports up to 1080p for its free
      version, which is impressive since that's pretty high quality for
      generally pretty short clips! </blockquote>
    <a href="https://malsync.moe/">MAL-Sync</a></br>
    <blockquote>Never worry about manually updating your animanga (anime and
      manga) list again. MAL-Sync supports <a

        href="https://anilist.co/">AniList</a>, <a

    <a href="https://mathpix.com/">Mathpix Snip</a></br>
    <blockquote> This is more than your typical OCR scanner. With automatic
      LaTeX support, screenshot formulas of your textbook or the web and convert
      them into LaTeX for your preferred documentation. While it also has
      features like a solver and some mixed results when trying to test it on
      the worst of math professors handwritting that make it a bit more
      questionable as a service, for a curious mind, the Stack Exchange search
      integration is super interesting to find related threads on specific
      formulatic topics. You can get an extra 50 snips (or 200 with an .edu

    <blockquote>Share information with a quick link that allows you to send
      text, such as passwords and other personal information, in a more secure

    <a href="https://www.podcastle.ai/">Podcastle</a>
    <blockquote>Podcastle is a screenreader optimized to convert articles into
      audio clips on your browser. Compared to other t2s programs, they use
      their own machine learning algorithmn to make the audio sound more natural
      to how it would be spoken. Another great feature is that after converting
      an article, you can then share that audio clip with others or embed it.

    <a href="https://www.pleco.com/">Pleco</a>
    <blockquote>The best Chinese dictionary app with must-have features for
      learners such as flashcards and OCR. Its dictionary sources are constantly
      expanding and it's been adapted for a number of variants including
      Taiwanese, Mandarin, Classical and Cantonese, with both Traditional and

    <blockquote>This desktop app detects what song you're listening to on
      Spotify and automaticaly fetches and displays the lyrics for that song

      way through a work session.</blockquote>
    <a href="https://www.xodo.com/">Xodo</a>
    <blockquote>Though not my favorite tool, Xodo gets the job done better than
      a free version of Adobe products or whatnot. The best part of Xodo is the
      abilitity to comment on highlights and other markdown annotations with
      addtional thoughts. With collaborative sharing features, this can lead to
      conversations. However, it's Google Drive support has been bugging lately,
      so while it generally has great app support, not being able to rely on
      cloud storage for syncing has been a bit of a thorn of my side. Though
      workarounds can be found, it's far from perfect. </blockquote>
    <a href="https://www.zgenda.net/">Zgenda</a>
    <blockquote>Wait wait wait... what are we talking about right now? Zgenda
      utilizes the captions feature of Zoom to broadcast your meeting agenda so
      that people know what you're discussing and how long you'll be doing it
      for. A simple and smart tool, though maybe not all it's cracked up to be,
      it's one less task for a moderator to worry about — assuming everyone
      knows how to utilize closed captions and will actually end their
      discussions on time. </blockquote>
    <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>
    <blockquote>Another tool I'll swear by for sure: Zotero makes organizing
      research, from preserving documents, to making highly adaptable
      bibliographies, and making your citations workflow a breeze. As an open
      source tool, tons of extensions that expand the features for a curated
      researcher's need, such as <a href="http://zotfile.com/">Zotfile</a>. It's
      Google Chrome and Google Doc extensions are also super easy to use.

    <blockquote> Manually track air time in a meeting or classroom and the flow
      of conversation. This interface allows you to easily create a map while
      folx in the room are speaking and then assess the results using equity
      analytics that take identity markers into consideration. The legitmacy of
      this approach and of imposing it on students might be a bit questionable —
      but it may ultimately be a necessary means of framing accountability in a
      space. This tool was used in some of my classes in high school, but there
      was no explanation of why the map was being made so I had no idea that
      there were analytics either. I only knew we were graded on the "balance"
      of the conversation, so I am not sure if an inequitable conversation was
      graded against those who were harmed by a space. </blockquote>

    <blockquote> Kast bought out the remains of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it">Rabb.it</a> which allowed
      you to host a room and share content on a virtual computer. It was known
      as an ideal loophole watch Netflix with other people. Skirting on
      questionable means, it's no wonder they did not end up getting full
      funding. Kast remains a streaming service, though only from their list of
      partners and services. It still remains an interesting tool for hosting
      watch parties with support for built-in chat and video call, but it
      certainly will NEVER be what Rabb.it once was. For security reasons? That
      might be for the better, at least for now. Using the platform definitely
      made me reminisce of the updated versions of Rabb.it... which I hated, but
      somehow was even more difficult to use than I was used to, thus I did away
      with it in the end. If you can get all your friends on it, it's worth a
      try.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Kosmi appears to be a browser-based Rabb.it alternative, again
      supporting voice and video for the purposes of creating a "How do I watch
      shows with my friends who don't have Netflix?" loophole, assuming the
      person who has Netflix is hosting the streaming from their browser.
      Generally the case when trying to screenshare Netflix by accessing it from
      a separate app, you'll get a black screen. My guess is since it's built
      into a browser exension, similar to Netflix party, there's no reason to
      have the stream disrupted. Haven't tried it myself since I'm not much of a
      Netflix person. </blockquote>

      Many of the core features make it a Zotero alternative. Where it lacks in
      open source support, mandatory cloud storage, snapshots and accruate
      metadata extraction, it glows in multi-platform app support and its
      personal catalogue of saved papers. If you're outside of institutional
      access to databases, this can be a really attractive resource.
